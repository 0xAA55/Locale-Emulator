Q: What is the easiest way to use LE?

Q: The english words "Run in Japanese" looks bad together with my OS. Can I change it?
A: Yes. Click on "Edit Global Profile List" -> "Save", then input another name.

Q: What is "Application Profile"?
A: You should use it when one of your application needs a arguments to run properly. Besides, you can create a shortcut on your desktop here.

Q: When I an running LiveMaker games, I need to wait for more than 10 seconds to see the game. Is this normal?
A: Yes. LiveMaker calls for EnumFontFamiliesEx API many times, and LE spend much time on that.

A: Select "Modify Application Profile", then click "Save".

Q: I want to move "Run in Japanese" item to the top-level of my context menu.
A: Select "Edit Global Profile List" and check "Show this profile in main menu".

Q: What is "CREATE_SUSPENDED"?
A: You will not ask the question if you really need this.

Q: The context menu is REALLY SLOW after I installed LE.
A: You can use a simplified version of context menu to run a application with LE. Copy the code below into a .reg file, modify path and "a6d2f812-2172-4d0e-981d-e8cc5dfd6bff" with the "Guid" found in your LEConfig.xml, then import it into your registry.

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\RunWithLE]
@="Run with Locale Emulator"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\RunWithLE\command]
@="C:\\Locale Emulator\\LEProc.exe \"-runas\" \"a6d2f812-2172-4d0e-981d-e8cc5dfd6bff\" \"%1\""


In case if you want to remove the context-menu, you can use this:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\RunWithLE]



Q: I found a registry item which is used been a application for checking system locale. How could I report it to LE?
A: Please report the item by the same ways for bug report. Thanks!
